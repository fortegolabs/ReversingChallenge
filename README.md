# ReversingChallenge
Hosted binary for a reversing challenge within Fortego

This is by no means any practical malware, and there is no responsibility held by the author if this executable is ran anywhere other than where it's intended. Do NOT run within production environments.


If you're looking to reverse this, and you are running a newer/updated version of Windows and Defender, you will need to either disable Defender, or if a security pop-up happens, allow this type of security threat on your device and maybe re-download.

It has some weird detections, where sometimes Defender will not flag at it all, sometimes it will flag after it's already executed, or as you're downloading. Keep in mind you might have to fuss with Windows config to allow this on the device, or it might run right away.

Enjoy!
